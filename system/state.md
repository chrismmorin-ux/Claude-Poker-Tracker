# System State

Last updated: 2026-06-20 (SPR-137/138/139 closed — domain-correctness first-principles cluster: WS-247 raise-gate EV fix (DEC-022), WS-244 STYLE_FOLD_DEFAULTS→logistic, WS-245 EV/PIP confidence-gating (DEC-024). Plus data-quality cap recalibrated 3→5 (DEC-023, cleared /next distortion) + FIND-007/010 findings-index reconciled. domain-correctness health 6→8.)

> **State-file discipline.** This file is the fast-scan canonical state of the system. It MUST stay readable in one screen.
> - Each row: terse. Detail belongs in linked files (project files, session files, SYSTEM_MODEL.md).
> - **Recent Sessions: last 5 only.** Older sessions go to `.claude/workstream/sessions/` (canonical CWOS form) or `system/state-history.md` (raw archive for sessions never captured as session files).
> - If a section grows past its row count, **prune and archive** — do not let it accumulate. The cumulative session changelog that used to live at the top was archived to `system/state-history.md` on 2026-05-10 because it had ballooned to ~40K tokens.
> - **Append discipline rule (binding):** at `/session-end`, the protocol must enforce this shape. Adding a new Recent Sessions row pushes the oldest to archive.

## Vital Signs

| Area | Status | Check | Detail |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Tests | GREEN | `bash scripts/smart-test-runner.sh` | This session verified `src/utils` 8,756 passing (300 files; 6 skipped) covering all engine/range/handAnalysis changes; +9 new tests across WS-247/244/245. Full app+extension suite not re-run (only UI change was a small RangeProvenance confidence badge, covered by clean build). |
| Build | GREEN | `npm run build` | Vite production build clean (PWA entries generated); import preflight clean (50 files) |
| Git | YELLOW | `git status --short` | **UNCOMMITTED** — SPR-137/138/139 source + test changes, system/decisions.md (DEC-022/023/024), findings + program YAML edits all staged-ready on `main`. Founder to commit. |
| Dependencies | NEEDS CHECK | `npm audit` | Last verified: never since CWOS adoption (2026-05-01) |

> 2026-06-10: engineering cap-breach (18 open vs cap 15) cleared by deferring 11 stale legacy items (HRP paused streams WS-068..073, Range Lab stretch phases WS-058..060, US-2 refit WS-062, event-driven WS-156) — all reversible with revival triggers in each YAML.

> **CWOS-ops pending — WS-212:** this repo is on **kit 3.5.0**; HomeBase is **3.8.0** and the `kit/scripts/` suite (`cwos-reconcile.js` et al.) was never installed (arrived in 3.6.0). Root cause of the recurring manual index-reconcile each session (friction fr-011…fr-014). Fix runs **from a HomeBase session** — `/adopt "<this repo>" --update`, then optional in-repo `/kit-upgrade`. See `WS-212` for the full runbook.

See `.claude/workstream/queue-index.yaml`. **Refactor Sprint anchor:** feature work paused; Items 1+2+3 DONE; Items 4 (decision-system extraction, NEXT), 5 (useLiveActionAdvisor split), 6 (queue triage) drive the next ~3–6 sessions.

| Date | Primary Work | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 2026-06-20 | **SPR-137/138/139 — domain-correctness first-principles cluster (3 sprints) + data-quality cap fix + findings reconcile** | Founder asked to work domain-correctness; `/next` kept auto-anchoring data-quality cap-breach items, so each sprint overrode the anchor to the real domain-correctness work. **WS-247 (SPR-137, plan-first):** removed the `heroEquity≥0.65` pre-gate in `bestResponseToAggression` that suppressed all +EV bluff/semi-bluff raises (FIND-029); now computes raiseEV unconditionally, sources no-model fold-to-raise from canonical `POPULATION_PRIORS.raise.fold`, and gates *fold-equity-driven* raises on a reliable read (founder ratified Option 1 — value raises always allowed, bluff-raises need a model). **DEC-022** + AS-N. **WS-244 (SPR-138):** routed two `STYLE_FOLD_DEFAULTS[style]` raw lookups (multiwayFoldPct + decisionTreeBuilder Priority 2) through the existing logistic machinery (style as prior); behavior-preserving at the curve midpoint, sizing-sensitive elsewhere (FIND-006/007). **WS-245 (SPR-139):** confidence-gated two display verdicts — `assessEV`→'unknown' below 10 hands; PIP deviations carry a confidence badge (FIND-009/010). Kept PIP confidence a PARALLEL `pipConfidence` map (not the ticket's nested shape) because nesting would break `runPipRules`; relocated `bayesianSampleConfidence` to pokerCore. **DEC-024.** **Then:** data-quality `max_open_items` 3→5 (**DEC-023**) — all 4 open items legitimate, cap was miscalibrated and floored real work above domain-correctness; verified `breached_programs:[]`. Reconciled FIND-007/010 (secondary findings on WS-244/245) to resolved — cleared the ungoverned-findings alert. Verified: `src/utils` 8,756 green (+9 new tests), build + preflight clean. domain-correctness health 6→8. **Uncommitted** — founder to commit. |
| 2026-06-13 | **SPR-126 — WS-221 global anchor-library calibration reset (red line #4b, design-gated destructive action)** | `/next` composed single-item plan-first sprint. Founder decisions (plan-mode): placement = Settings danger zone (not Calibration Dashboard); scope = anchors only (stamp `calibrationResetAt` across all anchors, preserve observations — red line #3 durability). **Shipped:** `LIBRARY_CALIBRATION_RESET` reducer action (reset + undo-restore paths, W-EA-5 writer registered in writers.js + WRITERS.md lockstep) + `buildLibraryResetCopy()` (AP-06-clean, count-aware) + `useLibraryReset` orchestrator (parallels useAnchorRetirement; 12s undo via prior-snapshot restore) + new self-contained `AnchorCalibrationResetSection.jsx` mounted propless in SettingsView (reuses shared `RetirementConfirmModal` 2-tap destructive confirm). **Design gates:** Gate 1 entry audit `2026-06-13-entry-global-anchor-library-reset.md` (GREEN, Gate 2 not triggered — reuses existing interaction pattern); Gate 4 surface update `settings-view.md` §EAL-G4-RESET + journey Variation C2 in `anchor-retirement.md`. **Contract suite:** `autonomyRedLines.test.jsx` it.todo for #4b replaced with 4 passing assertions + library-reset copy added to tone sweeps. New tests: useLibraryReset (14) + AnchorCalibrationResetSection (10) + reducer (6) + retirementCopy (3). Full suite 12,407/511 files green, **0 todo** (was 1); build clean (PWA 65 entries); Playwright-verified at portrait (section enabled with seeded anchor; 2-tap modal gated). |
| 2026-06-12 | **SPR-123 — resumed orphaned approved sprint: WS-227 tournament-zone builders + WS-225 PrototypeFinderView deletion** | `/next` gate showed no active sprint and composed a NEW sprint with the same two items — but premise check found WS-227 ALREADY SHIPPED (commit `513f284`, prior session: buildTournamentBarHTML/buildTournamentDetailHTML in render-orchestrator.js, single-source TOURNEY_ZONE_COLORS/ICM_ZONES, 27 zone-tournament tests, comment-debt cleanup) and WS-225 sitting UNCOMMITTED in the working tree. Root cause: prior session approved SPR-123 (status:approved), executed item 1, half of item 2, ended mid-sprint — and the gate only resumes status:active sprints (**2nd bite of `[[resume-approved-sprints]]` / fr-012, new variant: approved AND partially executed**). Discarded the duplicate composition, resumed SPR-123. **WS-227 verified:** extension suite 2,348/2,348 (80 files); harness rebuilt + Playwright re-verified betweenHandsTournament + zx_x5e critical-urgency (zero undefined/null/NaN; prior session's own Playwright run confirmed at 21:33-35Z artifacts). **WS-225 finished + committed (`e8e6c86`):** view + mockPlayers deleted (−1,694 lines), SCREEN.PROTOTYPE_FINDER route/hash/orientation wiring + AdminSection sandbox entry removed (decision noted: empty Admin section hides entirely), 4 extracted-primitive doc headers updated, zero dangling refs, build clean (PWA 66→64 entries). Full suite 12,348/507 — single failure is the documented load-flake class (component project green isolated). Both items closed via `done`; queue Backlog 41 / Done 151. |
| 2026-06-12 | **SPR-122 — shared IDB transaction helpers (WS-226) + refactor-candidate scan queued WS-225/227** | Founder-requested refactor scan (2 cto-agent reviewers: main app + extension) produced 3 queue items: WS-225 PrototypeFinderView deletion (P12/S), WS-226 persistence tx-helper dedup (P14/M), WS-227 extension tournament-zone pure-builder extraction (P13/M); second-tier findings (CommandStrip, AnchorObservationModal, diagnostics panel) deliberately NOT queued (opportunistic-only per scan verdict). `/next` anchored WS-226 (plan-first). **Founder decision (Medium): durable writes** — write helpers resolve on `tx.oncomplete` (after commit), not `request.onsuccess`; closes the resolve-then-rollback window (quota-at-commit class). **Shipped (commit `77d065e`):** 5 helpers in database.js (readTx/writeTx/updateTx/cursorTx/atomicTx; contract: raw-DOMException rejection — QuotaExceededError name-checks survive; helpers never log — modules' createPersistenceLogger try/catch owns swallow-vs-propagate) + all 19 persistence modules migrated behind unchanged public signatures (95/97 raw `db.transaction` sites collapsed; net −884 lines). Documented exceptions: batchUpdateSeatPlayers (bespoke abort-tracking) + deletePlayer (parallel cursor cascade) + migrations.js (versionchange, out of scope). NEW dbTransactions.test.js (19 tests: ConstraintError raw-error contract, updateTx rollback proof, atomicTx cross-store atomicity proof). Full suite 12,349/507 files green; build clean; only documented load flakes (all green isolated; AnchorObservationModal timeout added to the known list). SYSTEM_MODEL §1 persistence row updated (v27 + helper contract). |
| 2026-06-11 | **SPR-121 — extension WS replay seam test (WS-217) + HUD-drop fold bug FOUND AND FIXED** | `/next` composed single-item sprint (WS-216's extension twin, same seam audit); premise verified at composition — files + dataQuality string-vs-object mismatch confirmed, BUT spike-data/ contains NO raw WS frames (HTTP log only; 6th occurrence of `[[feedback_verify_ticket_premise_at_composition]]`, content-assumption variant). **Founder ratified "Both":** replay frames reconstructed in the documented wire format from SPIKE_REPORT-derived FULL_HAND_SEQUENCE now; WS-224 queued for real-capture swap. **Shipped (commit `000f4a5`):** `ws-replay-seam.test.js` (NEW, 10 tests, zero mocks) — encode→parseWsBatch round-trip (incl. whole-street Atmosphere batching), full-hand replay through real HSM (zero errors, record emitted, cards/pot/pfAggressor decoded), street-by-street render via the REAL wire transform (`buildLiveContext`) into `buildUnifiedHeaderHTML` + `renderStreetCard` with/without advice (no undefined/null/[object Object]/raw-pid/NaN), msgAdvice↔ADVICE_FIELDS wire-contract round-trip (flopBreakdown incident class now fails loudly) + producer-shape dataQuality pin. msgAdvice factory + 2 sibling fixtures fixed to object-shaped dataQuality. **PRODUCTION BUG caught on the test's first run (founder-ratified fix-now):** HSM `getLiveHandContext` emitted activeSeatNumbers with dealt-in semantics (folds never removed) while the STP-1 R-10.1 validator requires active∩folded=∅ — `validateMessage` gate in the SW silently DROPPED every live-context push from the first fold onward (HUD frozen mid-hand since STP-1; invisible because all fixtures were hand-built disjoint — exactly the fixture-vs-producer class WS-217 targets). **Decision (Medium):** subtraction at the context boundary only; internal activeSeats keeps dealt-in semantics (folded ⊆ active stays the `_verifyIntegrity` contract); all renderers + main-app consumers verified compatible (app filters folds itself). Extension suite 2,321/2,321 green (79 files). Visual harness not needed (no renderer changes; fixtures already disjoint). |
