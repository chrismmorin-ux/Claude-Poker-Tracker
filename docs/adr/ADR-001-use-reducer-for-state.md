# ADR-001: Use useReducer for State Management

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024 (v106)

## Context
The application started with useState hooks for managing state. As features grew, we faced:
- Complex state updates across multiple related values
- Difficulty tracking what changed state and why
- Action logic scattered across handler functions
- Testing state transitions was difficult

Options considered:
1. Continue with useState + careful organization
2. Adopt Redux for global state
3. Use useReducer with local reducers
4. Use Context API + useReducer

## Decision
Use **useReducer** with multiple domain-specific reducers:
- `gameReducer` - Game state (street, dealer, actions)
- `uiReducer` - UI state (selection, modals, sidebar)
- `cardReducer` - Card state (community, hole, player cards)
- `sessionReducer` - Session state (current session, history)
- `playerReducer` - Player state (database, seat assignments)

Each reducer:
- Has explicit action types as constants
- Maintains its own initial state
- Is independently testable
- Uses pure functions for all state transitions

## Alternatives Considered

### Redux
- **Pros**: Industry standard, great dev tools, middleware support
- **Cons**: Overkill for this app size, adds dependency, boilerplate

### useState only
- **Pros**: Simple, no learning curve
- **Cons**: State updates become unwieldy, hard to test transitions

### Single global reducer
- **Pros**: All state in one place
- **Cons**: Large reducer file, harder to maintain, all components re-render

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear action types document all possible state changes
- Reducers are pure functions - easy to test
- State transitions are predictable and traceable
- Domain separation keeps code organized
- Components dispatch actions, don't manage state logic

### Negative
- Learning curve for useReducer pattern
- More files (5 reducer files vs inline state)
- Need to coordinate when actions span multiple reducers

### Mitigations
- Created documented action type constants
- Added schema validation in reducers (debug mode)
- Test coverage for all reducer action types
