# ADR-002: Use IndexedDB for Persistence

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024 (v109)

## Context
The application needed to persist:
- Saved poker hands with full action history
- Session data (venues, buy-ins, results)
- Player database with profiles

Options considered:
1. localStorage - Simple key-value storage
2. IndexedDB - Full database in browser
3. External backend - Server-side database
4. File-based - Export/import JSON files

Requirements:
- Work offline (live poker venues have spotty wifi)
- Store complex nested objects
- Support querying (hands by session, players by name)
- No server dependency
- Free and unlimited storage

## Decision
Use **IndexedDB** via the browser's native API.

Structure:
- Database: `PokerTrackerDB`
- Object stores: `hands`, `sessions`, `players`, `activeSession`
- Indexes for efficient querying
- Migration system for schema changes (v1→v5)

## Alternatives Considered

### localStorage
- **Pros**: Simpler API, synchronous, universal support
- **Cons**: 5MB limit, no indexes, no transactions, strings only

### External backend
- **Pros**: Sync across devices, unlimited storage, better querying
- **Cons**: Requires server, costs money, needs internet, authentication complexity

### File-based export
- **Pros**: User controls data, portable, no storage limits
- **Cons**: Manual save/load, no automatic persistence, friction

## Consequences

### Positive
- Unlimited storage (browser-allocated, typically 50%+ of disk)
- Structured data with indexes for fast queries
- Works completely offline
- No server costs or maintenance
- Transactions ensure data integrity
- Migration system handles schema evolution

### Negative
- More complex API than localStorage
- Async operations require careful handling
- Different browsers have different storage limits
- Data lives in one browser only
- IndexedDB can be cleared by user "clear browsing data"

### Mitigations
- Created abstraction layer (`IStorage` interface)
- Export/import functionality for backup
- Clear error messages when storage fails
- Automatic migration system

## Migration History
- v1: Initial `hands` store
- v2: Added `sessions`, `activeSession` stores
- v3: Added session fields (venue, gameType, rebuyTransactions)
- v4: Added cashOut field to sessions
- v5: Added `players` store
